# Homework 01 - Introduction to Linux and Git - Instructions

For this assignment, you will be exploring Linux, the Khoury servers, and GIT. For this assignment, you will
need to make sure the following is in place

1. You have a Khoury Account Setup 
   * [Apply](https://my.khoury.northeastern.edu/account/apply) and 
   * Test your [profile](https://my.khoury.northeastern.edu/session/login)
2. Have your Github.com Account Setup ([Instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/signing-up-for-github/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account))
   * Free account is fine
   * We recommend a professional email that is not tied to a school, so your account exists after you graduate.
3. If you haven't already, in your canvas shell you will be provided with a Github classroom link that will
let you use this repository as a template for your work. 

## GIT Commit
Throughout this assignment you will be committing your changes to your repository. When you commit to Git.
* Commit frequently after every major change
* Use 'active'/ 'action' verbs in your message, that are short yet descriptive
  * Here is a BAD commit message
  > changes made to readme
  * Here is an example of a better commit message
  > Added personal ident info: name, gitname, semester

See resources for into on Git Commit

**NOTICE**: All assignments will need to have _at least_ three commits to earn full points. Most assignments will have many more than that (this is the only one who reaching three may be limited).
